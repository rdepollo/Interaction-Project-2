1417 VAN DYKE // Rob DePollo // CCS Winter 2018

This project was an attempt to create an interactive site that would serve as a repository of collected memories of Paramita Sound's record strore in Detroit's West Village neighborhood. Though Paramita Sound still exists and is currently occupying a temporary space while they look for a new permanent location, I felt that this space during the period was highly influential for me and I wanted to collect other people's feelings about the space in order to commemorate the impact that Paramita Sound had on the music community.
